#Code Examples
We start these examples with the data structures that are easiest to understand. In the later examples involving graphs, we will be using dataset from Stanford's Large Network Dataset Collection.
##Linked List
Linked lists are used in lower level languages that don't have the luxury of automatic array resizing. They are a useful data structure when you don't know how many items will be in this list, you need constant-time insertion and deletion and you don't need random access to any of the list's elements.
Visit wikipedia's on (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list linked lists) for a more thorough understanding.

In this example, we're going to make a conga line, using a singly linked list. Each node will represent a person and the pointer to next, will represent than hands on the shoulders of the person in front of them.

conga_lovers = ["James", "Tammy", "Arjav", ]
