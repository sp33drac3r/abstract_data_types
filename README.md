#Abstract Data Types

###Graph Base-type
* Directed Graph
* Undirected Graph

###Graph Sub-types
The two basic graph types above are flexible enough to extend more ridged data structures.
* Weighted Graph
* Vertex Labeled Graph
* Multi-graph
* Bi/n-ary tree
* A/cyclic Graph
* In/finite Graph

##Additional Data-types
None of the data structures below are best expressed in Ruby, but that doesn't mean they can't be. Using Ruby's array class to model these data-types unnecessarily limits to array's functionality.  Thus, these data structures are included solely for educational purposes.
* Linked List (single and double)
* Queue
* Stack
* Stackqueue

###Algorithms
* Depth-first Search (DFS)
* Breadth-first Search (BFS)
* Iterative Deepening Depth-first Search (IDDFS)
* Dijkstra's Algorithm

##Examples
Load any collection of data into

##Contributing
This project is my way of learning how to use data structures to model real-world problems. If you wish to contribute to this project, then I <3 you.
